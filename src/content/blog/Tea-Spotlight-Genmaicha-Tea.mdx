## Tea Profile:

- Genmaicha tea is a Japanese staple that consists of green tea blended with roasted brown rice. The green tea in Genmaicha is usually Sencha or Gyokuro tea.
- Historically, Genmaicha tea was consumed by those who could not afford more expensive green teas, and rice was added to make it last longer.

## Flavor Profile:

**Taste Characteristics:**

- This tea combines the smoothness of its green tea base with the nutty and toasted flavors of roasted brown rice.

**Aroma Characteristics:**

- Although some varieties of Genmaicha smell like popcorn, the blend of green tea leaves and roasted rice results in a sweet, nutty aroma.

**Color Characteristics:**

- This tea showcases a pale yellow-green hue

## How to Brew:

**Water Temperature:**

- Heat water to around 175-185°F (80-85°C), which is the appropriate temperature for green tea

**Steep Time:**

- Steep Genmaicha for approximately 2 to 3 minutes

## Suggested Sweeteners and Additives:

- Genmaicha is best enjoyed alone, but if sweetness is desired, a hint of honey or agave can complement the toasty notes without overwhelming the tea's delicate balance.
