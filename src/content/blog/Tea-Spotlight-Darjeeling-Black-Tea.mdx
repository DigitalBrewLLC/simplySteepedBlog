## Tea Profile:

- Darjeeling Black Tea, often called the "Champagne of Teas," hails from the Darjeeling district in West Bengal, India.
- It is known for its delicate and unique flavor profile, which results from the high altitude and cool climate in which it is grown.

## Flavor Profile:

**Taste Characteristics:**

- Darjeeling Black Tea offers a complex and nuanced flavor profile. Its combination of muscatel grape notes, a brisk and lively character, and a subtle astringency makes it distinctively refreshing.
- The taste is a balanced blend of delicate, floral, fruity, and spiciness with a light body.

**Aroma Characteristics:**

- The aroma is often floral and musky, with hints of sweetness that evoke the essence of blooming gardens and orchards.

**Color Characteristics:**

- This tea exhibits a bright and amber-hued infusion, reflecting the tea's lively and vibrant champagne nature.

## How to Brew:

**Water Temperature:**

- Optimal brewing is achieved with water heated to around 195-205°F (90-96°C), unlocking the full spectrum of Darjeeling's delicate flavors.

**Steep Time:**

- Steep one teaspoon of tea leaves per cup of water for 3-4 minutes.
- Increase the amount of tea leaves and/or steeping time for a stronger cup of tea.

## Suggested Sweeteners and Additives:

- The Champagne of Teas is best enjoyed without any sweeteners or additives, as it has a unique flavor profile that should be savored. However, if you prefer a sweeter taste, a small amount of honey or sugar can be added.
- Avoid adding too much milk, as it can overpower the delicate flavor of the tea.
