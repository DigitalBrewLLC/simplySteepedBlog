## Introduction

Tea grading is the process of categorizing tea based on the quality and size of the leaves, like how diamonds are evaluated and classified based on criteria such as cut, clarity, color, and carat weight to determine their value. How tea leaves are graded directly influences how they are valued and priced for consumers, with whole tea leaves on the high end, tea dust on the low end, and broken leaves in the middle. Tea grading can vary depending on the type of tea, the country of origin, and tea processing methods (think matcha vs. green tea). Still, this article will focus on the three traditional grades: Whole, Broken, and Dust.

## The Basics of Tea Grading

- Whole Leaf refers to tea made from unbroken leaves. Whole leaves often signify high quality, retaining most of their original flavor and aroma.
- Broken Leaf tea is made from leaves that have been intentionally broken or fractured during processing. Due to their greater exposed surface area, broken leaves brew stronger tea than whole leaves.
- Tea Dust refers to the smallest particles of tea leaves left over after processing higher grades. This grade is used in tea bags because it imparts intense flavor and brews quickly.

## Factors Influencing Tea Quality and Grade

- **Leaf size and appearance**
  - Whole leaves are considered higher quality and are typically associated with more delicate and nuanced flavors. On the other hand, broken leaves, while capable of producing a more potent brew, might be considered lower in quality due to the increased likelihood of bitterness.
- **Color and texture**
  - The color and texture of tea leaves indicate their processing and oxidation levels. For example, green teas should be vibrant green, while black teas should have a rich, dark hue.
- **Aroma and flavor profiles**
  - The flavor and characteristics of a tea are determined by where it is grown, its type, and how it is processed. Generally, a tea with a rich, complex aroma and a balanced flavor profile often indicates a higher grade.
- **Processing methods**
  - Traditional, artisanal methods, such as hand-plucked tea followed by careful withering and hand-rolling, contribute to preserving the tea's quality. In contrast, mass-market tea production and the use of additives impact both taste and quality.
- **Geography and climate**
  - The soil composition, climate, and even the time of day when the tea is plucked can influence the final product. High-end specialty teas use subtle variations in these factors to enhance their unique characteristics.
  - Darjeeling tea, the "Champagne of Teas," is known for its exquisite flavor and aroma, which are deeply influenced by the unique terroir of the Darjeeling region.

## The Grading Process: Step by Step

Tea grading starts with the harvest and follows the leaves through the entire processing journey until they become the final product for the consumer. It is important to note that tea leaves can decrease grade as they are processed.

How are tea leaves graded at each of the following stages:

- **Plucking and initial sorting**
  - During this stage, whole tea leaves are separated from the rest. Harvesters focus on plucking the top leaves of the tea plant to preserve two leaves and a bud. Once plucked, leaves are sorted based on quality, and damaged leaves are removed. The highest-graded leaves in this step will remain intact during the tea processing.
  - Include a graphic of the tea leave plant and where the quality of the leaves is determined.
  - include terminology definitions
- **Drying and withering**
  - Tea leaves are withered, fried, or withered to reduce their moisture content and make them more pliable for shaping and rolling in later steps. Think of this as a prepping stage.
  - Properly withered leaves are less prone to breaking into very fine particles during rolling/shaping, slightly reducing dust production. If tea leaf integrity is negatively affected, the tea grading may also fall if tea leaves break in the following steps.
- **Rolling/shaping**
  - The quality of tea grades is heavily impacted at this stage. How tea is rolled or shaped contributes to both flavor and appearance. The oxidation process is initiated at this step as tea leaves are molded, and their cellular structure is broken down, releasing flavors and aromas. The resulting shape will influence how the tea unfurls and tastes during brewing. Tea will be graded based on the quality of its physical characteristics and sensory profile.![](/src/assets/tea-whole-leaf.png)
- **Final sorting and grading**
  - Finally, tea is graded based on leaf size, shape, and how well they've managed through the tea processing.
    - Leaves that fall into the fanning and tea dust grades produce tea bags or powder mixes for instant tea.
    - Leaves that fall into the whole or broken leaf grades are used to produce loose-leaf tea products.![](/src/assets/tea-fannings.png)

## How Grading Affects Tea Price and Selection

- Tea grade and price are proportional to one another. The higher the grade, the higher the price. Higher grades typically consist of tea leaves that survive processing wholly intact and rarer teas. These teas command higher prices due to their superior flavor, aroma, and artisanal processing methods. Conversely, lower grades like fannings and dust, often used in tea bags, are priced more affordably due to their mass production and more robust, astringent flavors.
  - NOTE: Fannings are tea particles larger than dust but smaller than broken leaf grades.
- It's important to note that while higher-graded tea is considered superior, sensory evaluation is subjective when grading tea. Tea tasters usually grade tea based on aroma, flavor, color, and mouthfeel. The evaluation strategy may even vary based on the tea and culture. Different tasters may arrive at different conclusions for the same tea, making grading somewhat inconsistent and entirely subjective.
- Consumers can use tea grading to select teas that match their taste preferences and budgets. Understanding the nuances between whole leaf, broken leaf, and dust grades can help you make informed decisions when selecting and understanding whether a tea is considered high or low quality.

## Conclusion

- Your tea palate should ultimately be based on personal preference. Don't be pressured to select tea based on grade alone. Use this guide to make more nuanced and informed decisions when discovering new tea and understanding the quality of the leaves you brew.
