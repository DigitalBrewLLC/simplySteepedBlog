## Tea Profile:

- Matcha tea is a finely ground, powdered green tea originating from Japan. It is crafted from shade-grown tea leaves, which enhances chlorophyll production and boosts the leaves' vibrant green color.
- Matcha is set apart from other green teas with its ceremonial significance and the consumption of the entire tea leaf, as opposed to traditional steeped tea.

## Flavor Profile:

- Taste Characteristics
  - The classic matcha brew has a distinctive, rich, and umami flavor. Unami translates to ‘savory taste’ in English. The complexity of the flavor can be likened to dark chocolate or the undertones of almonds.
  - The common flavor profiles of matcha include a balanced combination of umami, sweetness, and a trace of slight bitterness, presenting a vibrant and velvety green tea experience.
- Aroma Characteristics:
  - Evokes the essence of sun-kissed leaves
- Color Characteristics:
  - Depending on the quality of matcha and how it is prepared and stored, the hue of tea can range from a deep emerald green to a light, vibrant green.
  - Color is an indicator of the tea’s freshness and quality.
